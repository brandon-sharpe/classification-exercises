The photos are then put through a two step process. First an automated algorithm tags pictures as either a cat or a dog (Phase I). Next, the photos that have been initially identified are put through another round of review, possibly with some human oversight, before being presented to the users (Phase II).Several models have already been developed with the data, and you can find their results here.Given this dataset, use pandas to create a baseline model (i.e. a model that just predicts the most common class) and answer the following questions:\n",
